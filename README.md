# Planner

A humble cross-platform TUI task planning app focusing on easy-to-learn keyboard navigation and key binds. Supports Vim-like navigation and implements various modes similar to those in Vim.

It is written in go, and uses the wonderful Bubble Tea framework under the hood.

While the basic functionality was already implemented, the app should be considered a beta software, and some essential features such as task editing are still being developed.
