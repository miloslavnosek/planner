# Planner

A humble cross-platform TUI task planning app focusing on easy-to-learn keyboard navigation and key binds. Supports Vim-like navigation and implements various modes similar to those in Vim.

It is written in go, and uses the wonderful Bubble Tea framework under the hood.

The app is still a beta software. Bugs might occur.
